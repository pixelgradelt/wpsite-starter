# PixelgradeLT WPSite Starter

A Git repository to use as a starting point for new PixelgradeLT sites.

## Overview

This is a modern WordPress stack that comes with a better folder structure, predictable management (based on Composer), easy configuration, and solid security practices.

On top of what Bedrock offers, we lay our PixelgradeLT ecosystem to deliver for blissful experiences in creating and managing WordPress sites. 

**We take upon ourselves responsibilities such as updates, security, performance, so you don't have to.**

## Bedrock Features

- Better folder structure
- Dependency management with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- Easy WordPress configuration with environment specific files
- Environment variables with [Dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)
- Autoloader for mu-plugins (use regular plugins as mu-plugins)
- Enhanced security (separated web root and secure passwords with [wp-password-bcrypt](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt))

## Requirements

- PHP >= 7.1
- Composer - [Install](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)

## Credits

The site structure is based on the wonderful work of [Roots](https://roots.io/) called [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock).
